This card embodies the energies of sudden change, revelation.<br>And inner transformation.<br><br> The Tower represents the process of shattering illusions, challenging one's perception.<br>And forcing a paradigm shift as an individual is forced to confront harsh realities and face their shadow aspects. It signifies that sometimes chaos must reign before rebirth can occur.<br><br>💖 Love: Reliable Devotion and a Golden Future<br> This card advises breaking free from relationships or emotional patterns that have been holding you back, forcing you to see things as they truly are, rather than how you wish them to be.
